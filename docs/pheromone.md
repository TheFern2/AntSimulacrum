Here's a more detailed look at how ants utilize pheromones:
1. Trail Pheromones for Foraging:

    Food Source Navigation:
    When an ant discovers a food source, it releases trail pheromones as it returns to the nest. 

Trail Reinforcement:
Other ants following the trail also deposit pheromones, making the trail stronger and more attractive to other foragers. 
Maintaining the Trail:
The trail pheromones are constantly renewed by returning ants, ensuring the trail remains visible and active until the food source is depleted. 

2. Alarm Pheromones for Defense:

    Danger Signals:
    Ants release alarm pheromones to alert their colony to a perceived danger, such as a predator or intruder.
    Swarming Behavior:
    The alarm pheromone triggers a defensive response, with ants swarming to attack the threat or defend the colony. 

3. Colony Identification and Social Status:

    Colony Scent:
    Each ant colony has a unique scent, produced by specialized glands, which helps ants recognize nest mates from outsiders.
    Caste Identification:
    Different castes within the colony (e.g., workers, soldiers) also have distinct pheromone profiles, aiding in social organization. 

4. Other Uses:

    Sex Pheromones:
    Some ant species use pheromones to attract mates, says Pest World for Kids. 

Aggregation Pheromones:
Certain ants use pheromones to attract other ants to form groups or colonies, says the University of Kentucky. 
Trophallaxis:
Ants can also exchange information through trophallaxis, where they share food and other substances that contain pheromones,
