# AntSimulacrum: 2D Ant Simulator Plan

## Core Features

### Ant Simulation
- Individual ant entities with basic AI
- Pheromone trail system for navigation and communication
- Food collection and transportation
- Ant colony with queen, workers, and soldiers
- Life cycle simulation (eggs, larvae, pupae, adults)
- Energy/hunger mechanics

### Environment
- Procedurally generated terrain
- Day/night cycle affecting ant behavior
- Weather effects (rain, heat, cold)
- Obstacles and natural predators
- Food sources that regenerate over time
- Underground colony visualization

### Game Mechanics
