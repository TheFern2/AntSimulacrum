# TODO

This ECS architecture provides a solid foundation for Phase 1 implementation. Next steps would be to:
- Integrate the ECS with your existing game loop
- Convert the current entities (ants, food, etc.) to use the ECS
- Add more components and systems to implement specific behaviors like pheromone trails

The ants currently have simple wandering behavior, but this provides a foundation for implementing more complex ant behaviors in the future, such as:
- [x] Following pheromone trails
- Searching for food
- Carrying food back to the nest
- Interacting with the environment
